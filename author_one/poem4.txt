woman eaten by cats

someone is eating my eyes one by one, and stripping the flesh from my ears, climbing into my chest, pulling out my heart. those must be whiskers i’m feeling on my skin. little whiskers and also light scratches; i bleed, feel somebody’s tongue and tiny teeth. it’s simultaneous, all over my body, on my face, scalp, feet, stomach, chest. all of me covered in soft footfalls. one thing: it doesn’t hurt, or tickle; that’s all. the beating of four delirious paws, overwhelming me.

i don’t know how i ended up in this room, don’t know how i fell unconscious as they rushed forward. they began to devour me, little by little. nibble by nibble, lapping at me. i no longer have a nose, it’s a hole. nor a windpipe. another hole.

i must’ve lived alone in this horrible house. someone abandoned me, and let them seize everything.

my neighbor is from tucumán. my neighbor hates me. she’s blocked off the window. there’s no light, everything is dark, she’s closed me in. she thinks she owns the light. she raised the cats, and then they came to my house.

and i fell, parched, lightless. my neighbor must be happy. i have no lips. there was no one to kiss me.

i am not hot or cold. someone should tell my neighbor to open the window. that way the cats will go back the way they came.
